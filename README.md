# ZLadder

Ladder engine for running on arduino platforms. This engine is created as an easier way to load relay logics into arduino controllers, allowing a PLC-like definition that can be use um multiple practical scenarios, from academy to professional.

Each zLadder controller have it's own UUID that can be use to uniquely identify it from others. It is also able to monitor the states of their ports and variables, allowing a real-time interaction between the controller and external systems.

ZLadder still under construction and most of these features are not available.
